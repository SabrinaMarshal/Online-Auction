# Online-Auction
In this time of pandemic, social distancing is important. However, there is always the need to go out and buy things. To buy or sell anything in an auction, one has to travel to the auction house and sit in a room with many other people. This can possibly lead to the spreading of infection. Therefore, participating in auctions is not possible in these times. These problems can be solved using an online auction site. Using this website, you can buy products at prices of your choice and sell products at the best possible prices. You can buy or sell anything from the safety of your house. Thus, reducing the possibility of getting infected.
